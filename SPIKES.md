# SPIKES.md — Feasibility findings

Durable record of the de-risking spikes run for the desktop / cgo-free / in-process
architecture. These results are the evidence behind the decisions in
[`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md). **Don't re-run these from scratch — read here first.**

Dates are when verified. Environment: Windows 11 host, Go 1.26, Docker (Linux), GitHub Actions
(macOS), an Android emulator.

## TL;DR — the cgo-free thesis holds on all three desktop OSes

A native OS webview inherently binds C/ObjC APIs, so historically it needs cgo. The spikes
proved a **cgo-free** path on every desktop OS:

| OS | Mechanism | Status | Verified how |
|----|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Windows** | `github.com/jchv/go-webview2` (WebView2 via COM/syscall) | ✅ builds + runs | `CGO_ENABLED=0` build; ran multi-window on the dev's desktop |
| **Linux** | `purego` + `dlopen` of GTK/WebKit | ✅ mechanism proven | `dlopen`+call in a `golang:1.26` container (Spike 1) |
| **macOS** | `purego` + WKWebView | ✅ JS↔Go on real hardware | GitHub Actions Apple-Silicon runner (Spike 2) |

Consequence: builds stay `CGO_ENABLED=0` and **cross-compilation works** (darwin was
cross-built from Windows). Per-OS runners are still needed for signing/notarization/packaging
and interactive GUI testing — not for compilation.

## Spike 0 — the CGO_ENABLED=0 vs `webview_go` defect (2026-07-09)

**Finding:** `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./runtime/...` fails — `"build constraints exclude all Go
files in …/webview_go"` — because `github.com/webview/webview_go` is entirely cgo-gated.
`goleo build` forced `CGO_ENABLED=0`, so the native-webview desktop path could not compile;
it only worked under a cgo build (`go run`).

**Decision:** native webview needs cgo *or* a cgo-free binding. → adopt go-webview2 (Windows,
cgo-free) + purego (mac/linux); set per-OS `CGO_ENABLED` in `buildForDesktop` (Windows 0).

## Spike: go-webview2 is cgo-free on Windows (2026-07-09)

**Method:** scratch module, `go get github.com/jchv/go-webview2`, build a WebView2 app with
`CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows`.

**Result:** ✅ builds (3.9 MB exe); `go list -deps` shows **no `runtime/cgo`** in the tree
(COM via `syscall` + `go-winloader`). Public API mirrors `webview_go`
(`New/Navigate/SetTitle/SetSize/Eval/Run/Destroy`), plus a lower-level `pkg/edge` layer
(`Chromium`, `WebResourceRequested`, `CreateWebResourceResponse`, `Bind`) usable for custom
schemes / multi-window.

---

## Spike 1 — Linux cgo-free `dlopen` via purego (2026-07-09) ✅ PASS

**The feared blocker:** a `CGO_ENABLED=0` Go binary is normally statically linked on Linux and
cannot `dlopen`.

**Method:** `golang:1.26` Docker container; `purego.Dlopen("libgtk-3.so.0")` +
`RegisterLibFunc` → call `gtk_get_major_version()`, across three build modes.

**Result:** returned `3` under **`CGO_ENABLED=0` (default build)**, `CGO_ENABLED=0
-buildmode=pie`, and `CGO_ENABLED=1` — all exit 0. purego's `//go:cgo_import_dynamic`
directives make even the `CGO_ENABLED=0` binary **dynamically linked** (ELF interpreter
`ld-linux`), so `dlopen` works. The static-binary fear did **not** materialize.

**Caveats / remaining Linux work:** tested amd64 + glibc/Debian with **GTK3** (the `dlopen`
mechanism is version-agnostic). Still to confirm: **arm64**, and a real **`webkitgtk`** lib.
Remaining engineering (not feasibility): GObject signal marshaling (`g_signal_connect_data` +
`purego.NewCallback`), webkit version fragmentation (4.0/libsoup2 · 4.1/libsoup3 · 6.0/GTK4),
main-thread dispatch (`g_idle_add`). Needs the binary dynamically linked + `ld.so` + libs
present at runtime (always true on desktop Linux; a fully-static/musl/distroless target would
not work).

## Spike 2 — macOS purego WKWebView JS↔Go (2026-07-10) ✅ PASS on real hardware

**Method:** GitHub Actions `macos-14` (Apple Silicon/arm64), `go1.26.4 darwin/arm64`,
`CGO_ENABLED=0`. A purego/objc spike that:
1. `objc.RegisterClass` a `WKScriptMessageHandler` delegate whose method is a **Go func**
   (`objc.MethodDef{Fn: …}`),
2. loads HTML that calls `window.webkit.messageHandlers.external.postMessage(...)` (JS→Go),
3. from Go calls `evaluateJavaScript` to post back (Go→JS), completing a round-trip.

**Result:** `RESULT: PASS`. The delegate fired both times. Two behaviors that were unverified
beforehand **worked first try**: passing a **`CGRect` struct-by-value** to
`initWithFrame:configuration:`, and a **nil `completionHandler`** to `evaluateJavaScript:`.
No cgo, no local Mac. Also: the same spike **cross-compiled from Windows** for darwin/arm64 +
darwin/amd64 (`CGO_ENABLED=0`).

**purego/objc API used:** `Dlopen`/`Dlsym`/`RegisterLibFunc`; `objc.GetClass`, `RegisterName`,
`ID.Send`, generic `Send[T]`, `RegisterClass(name, super, protocols, ivars, []MethodDef)`,
`Class.AddMethod`, `NewIMP`, `MethodDef{Cmd SEL, Fn any}`. Production-proven on macOS by
Ebitengine.

**Caveats:** ran headless — interactive window/dock UX and the `WKURLSchemeHandler` asset path
are **unexercised**; the `macos-13`/amd64 matrix job was not confirmed; gomobile's Swift
arg-label generation for multi-arg methods is a guess (iOS provider wiring is unverified).

## Spike — gogpu/systray is cgo-free (tray) (2026-07-09)

**Method:** `go get github.com/gogpu/systray@v0.1.1`; build a tray app `CGO_ENABLED=0
GOOS=windows`.

**Result:** ✅ builds (no `runtime/cgo`; uses `go-webgpu/goffi` FFI + `godbus` on Linux). API:
`New()`, `SetIcon/SetTooltip/SetMenu`, `OnClick/OnRightClick`, `ShowNotification`, `Run()`,
`Remove()`; `NewMenu().Add(label, onClick)`.

**Critical constraint:** `internal/init.go` calls `runtime.LockOSThread()` and `tray.Run()`
owns the **main thread's** loop. A native webview also wants the main thread → **a tray app
forces the main process to be a headless controller with windows as child processes** (or an
in-process single-loop that the tray shares). This mandated the "hidden-master" lifecycle
model, not just suggested it.

---

## Spike (D4) — Windows in-process multi-window (2026-07-10) ✅ PASS on the dev's desktop

**Question:** can `go-webview2` host two windows in one process, cheaply, without the
`edge`-layer single-loop rewrite?

**Method:** `spikes/win-multiwindow/` — two `webview2.NewWithOptions` windows, each on its own
`runtime.LockOSThread` goroutine (Windows gives each thread a message queue), with distinct
WebView2 data dirs. `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows`.

**Result:** ✅ two independent windows appeared and worked, one process, two UI threads.

**Decision:** in-process multi-window on **Windows** is cheap — no `edge` single-loop rewrite
needed for basic multi-window; each window = one `LockOSThread` goroutine running `Run()`.
This is the D4.0 Windows path (the alternative to the shipped multi-process `WindowManager`).
Cross-thread control (close a window from the backend) uses the webview's `Dispatch(func)` +
`Terminate`. macOS is the exception: AppKit is main-thread-only, so extra windows there still
need the single-loop richer binding (not the per-thread trick).

## Cross-cutting testing learnings (not "spikes" but hard-won)

- **CI mobile guard must target GOOS=android/ios, never the host.** `linux + mobilebuild` is an
  unreal combination that trips cgo-only desktop files (`camera_linux.go` under `CGO_ENABLED=0`)
  and says nothing about mobile safety. Real gomobile compile set = `GOOS=android`/`ios`
  `-tags mobilebuild`.
- **Android dev must serve the UI over a secure context.** `goleo emulate android` loading from
  `http://10.0.2.2` (not a secure context) silently disables the WebView's secure-context-only
  APIs — `getUserMedia`/camera, clipboard, geolocation. Production (`http://127.0.0.1`) is
  secure and works. Fix: serve dev over `http://localhost` via `adb reverse` → the whole class
  works in emulation. (Discovered via "clipboard doesn't work on Android".)
- **A cgo webview + `CGO_ENABLED=0` are mutually exclusive** — the root cause behind several
  findings above; the cgo-free bindings are what let goleo keep `CGO_ENABLED=0`.
